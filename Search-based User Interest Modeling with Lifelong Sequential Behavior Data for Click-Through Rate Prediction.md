## ABSTRACT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Rich user behavior data has been proven to be of great value for click-through rate prediction tasks, especially in industrial applications such as recommender systems and online advertising. Both industry and academy have paid much attention to this topic and propose different approaches to modeling with long sequential user behavior data. Among them, memory network based model MIMN[8] proposed by Alibaba, achieves SOTA with the co-design of both learning algorithm and serving system. MIMN is the first industrial solution that can model sequential user behavior data with length scaling up to 1000. However, MIMN fails to precisely capture user interests given a specific candidate item when the length of user behavior sequence increases further, say, by 10 times or more. This challenge exists widely in previously proposed approaches.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In this paper, we tackle this problem by designing a new modeling paradigm, which we name as Search-based Interest Model (SIM). SIM extracts user interests with two cascaded search units: (i) General Search Unit (GSU) acts as a general search from the raw and arbitrary long sequential behavior data, with query information from candidate item, and gets a Sub user Behavior Sequence (SBS) which is relevant to candidate item; (ii) Exact Search Unit (ESU) models the precise relationship between candidate item and SBS. This cascaded search paradigm enables SIM with a better ability to model lifelong sequential behavior data in both scalability and accuracy. Apart from the learning algorithm, we also introduce our hands-on experience on how to implement SIM in large scale industrial systems. Since 2019, SIM has been deployed in the display advertising system in Alibaba, bringing 7.1% CTR and 4.4% RPM lift, which is significant to the business. Serving the main traffic in our real system now, SIM models sequential user behavior data with maximum length reaching up to 54000, pushing SOTA to 54x.

## 简介
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
丰富的用户行为数据在点击率预测任务中被证明具有极大的价值，尤其是在推荐系统和在线广告等工业应用中。无论是业界还是学术界，都对这一主题给予了大量关注，并提出了多种长序列用户行为数据建模的方法。其中，阿里巴巴提出的基于记忆网络的模型MIMN[8]，通过学习算法与服务系统的联合设计达到了当前最优（SOTA）的效果。MIMN是第一个能够处理长度扩展到1000的用户行为序列数据的工业解决方案。然而，当用户行为序列长度进一步增加，比如扩大到10倍或更多时，MIMN在准确捕捉特定候选项对应的用户兴趣方面表现不佳。这一挑战在此前提出的多种方法中普遍存在。

在本文中，我们通过设计一种新的建模范式来解决这一问题，该方法被称为基于搜索的兴趣模型（Search-based Interest Model, SIM）。SIM通过两个级联的搜索单元提取用户兴趣：（i）通用搜索单元（General Search Unit, GSU）利用候选项的查询信息，从原始且任意长的用户行为序列中进行通用搜索，获取与候选项相关的子用户行为序列（Sub user Behavior Sequence, SBS）；（ii）精确搜索单元（Exact Search Unit, ESU）建模候选项与SBS之间的精确关系。该级联搜索范式使得SIM在可扩展性和精确性方面具备了更强的能力，从而能够更好地建模终身的用户行为数据序列。除了学习算法外，我们还介绍了如何在大规模工业系统中实现SIM的实践经验。自2019年以来，SIM已部署在阿里巴巴的展示广告系统中，带来了7.1%的CTR提升和4.4%的RPM提升，这对业务来说是非常显著的。如今，SIM已在实际系统中服务主流流量，能够处理长度达到54000的用户行为数据序列，是当前最优水平的54倍
